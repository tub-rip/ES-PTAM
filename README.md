## Data Processing Pipeline

![pipeline](docs/pipeline_esptam.png)

### Input
* Events from two or more cameras
* Camera calibration (intrinsic, extrinsic) parameters

### Output
* Camera (i.e., sensor rig) poses
* Depth map
* Confidence map
* Point cloud
* Intermediate ray density maps / Disparity Space Images (DSI)

## Code
* [Installation](docs/installation.md)
* [Running examples on different datasets](docs/examples.md)
* [Running live with DAVIS cameras](docs/live_demo.md)
* [Parameter tuning](docs/parameters.md)

## Results
The original ES-PTAM trajectories and GT poses for various sequences are available [here](trajectory_eval).

They have been evaluted using [this tool](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_trajectory_evaluation/tree/master).
